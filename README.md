# Project Alpha

A voxel based game in [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) using
[Zylann's voxel module](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel).

The current plan is to be similar to Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, and RimWorld in
gameplay, incorporating elements of AI, automation, emergent phenomena, and
story telling through gameplay.
